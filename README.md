# Job Web Scrapping
Script, written in JavaScript, that does some web automation and web/data scraping.

The purpose of the script is to fetch job posting data from select company career websites.
For example, the script will go to a hard-coded company website and enter some filter criteria. Then it will get that data.
After getting data from multiple company sites, that data will be aggregated. Kind of like a personal Monster.com or Glassdoor.com script.

# Notes: 
- Results may change depending on markup. If existing markup is changed, this script won't work.
- This script is very specific and isn't scalable. It's specific to pre-selected job filters and companies.


# Install:
```
$ nmp install
$ node ScrapeStateFarm.js
```
